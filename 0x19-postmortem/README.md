Incident Report
Summary
On May 13, 2023, a Google API outage occurred that affected our website. The outage lasted for 7 minutes, from 00:30 to 00:37 WAT. During this time, 100% of our users were unable to access our website.

Impact
The outage had a significant impact on our website. During the outage, we lost all revenue and were unable to provide our services to our users. We also received a number of complaints from our users.

Root Cause
The root cause of the outage was a bug in the Google API that we were using. The bug caused the API to return incorrect results, which in turn caused our website to crash.

Timeline
00:30: The issue was detected by our monitoring system.
00:31: An engineer was contacted and began investigating the issue.
00:32: The engineer identified the bug in the Google API.
00:33: The engineer contacted Google to report the bug.
00:34: Google fixed the bug in the API.
00:35: The engineer updated our website to use the fixed version of the API.
00:37: The website was restored and all users were able to access it again.
Root Cause and Resolution
The bug in the Google API was caused by a typo in the code. The typo caused the API to return incorrect results when it was called with certain parameters. This incorrect data caused our website to crash.

The bug was fixed by Google by correcting the typo in the code. Once the bug was fixed, we updated our website to use the fixed version of the API. This restored our website and allowed all users to access it again.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
We have taken a number of steps to prevent this type of outage from happening again. First, we have improved our monitoring system so that we can detect bugs more quickly. Second, we have worked with Google to improve the quality of their APIs. Third, we have developed a better plan for dealing with outages.

Lessons Learned
We have learned a number of lessons from this incident. First, we need to be more careful when selecting third-party APIs. Second, we need to improve our monitoring system so that we can detect and fix bugs more quickly. Third, we need to have a better plan for dealing with outages.
